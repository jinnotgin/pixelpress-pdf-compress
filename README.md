# PixelPress PDF Compressor

A web-based tool to compress large PDFs (especially from design tools like Figma) by rasterizing pages into images, or to combine all pages of a PDF into a single, large image.

It features a multi-file upload queue, real-time progress tracking, and customizable output settings, all managed through a clean and simple web interface. The included setup scripts provide a fully automated environment configuration for macOS.

## Why PixelPress?

Design tools like Figma often export PDFs with enormous file sizes due to complex vector data, making them difficult to share. PixelPress solves this problem by converting each page into a lightweight, rasterized image (like a JPEG or PNG) and then packaging those images into a new, much smaller PDF. This makes the files significantly easier to store, share, and view, while retaining visual fidelity.

## Core Features

-   **Compress PDFs:** Converts complex vector pages into optimized images (JPEG/PNG) within a new PDF, often resulting in a dramatic reduction in file size.
-   **Combine to Image:** Stitches all PDF pages vertically into a single, downloadable image file.
-   **Asynchronous & Queued Processing:** Upload multiple files at once. The server processes them one by one in the background so you don't have to wait.
-   **Live Progress Tracking:** Monitor the real-time status of your files, from "Queued" to "Processing" to "Completed", with a progress bar.
-   **Customizable Output:**
    -   Choose between **PDF** or a single **stitched Image** as your final output.
    -   Control the **DPI (Dots Per Inch)** for image quality.
    -   Select the internal **image format (JPEG/PNG)**.
    -   Adjust **JPEG quality** for a perfect balance between size and quality.
-   **Task Management:** Cancel in-progress jobs or clear completed/failed items from your history. Your session is remembered in your browser via `localStorage`.
-   **Drag & Drop Interface:** A modern, user-friendly UI for easy file uploads.
-   **Memory Efficient:** Uses a tiling strategy to process very high-resolution pages without running out of memory.
-   **Automatic Cleanup:** The server automatically cleans up old files (default: 72 hours) to conserve disk space.

## Technology Stack

-   **Backend:** Python 3, Flask, PyMuPDF, Pillow
-   **Database:** SQLite
-   **Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap, Vanilla JavaScript (Fetch API)
-   **WSGI Server:** Gunicorn
-   **Development Environment (macOS):** Homebrew, pyenv, pyenv-virtualenv

## Getting Started (Automated macOS Setup)

These scripts provide a one-click setup and run experience on **macOS**.

### Prerequisites

-   **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Required for `pyenv` to build Python from source. If you don't have them, install them by running this command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
-   **Homebrew**: The script will install this for you if it's missing.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pixelpress-pdf-compressor.git
cd pixelpress-pdf-compressor
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

This script automates the entire environment setup. Make it executable and run it.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The script will perform the following actions:
-   ‚úÖ Install **Homebrew** (if not present).
-   ‚úÖ Install **pyenv** and the **pyenv-virtualenv** plugin.
-   ‚úÖ Configure your shell (`.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`) for `pyenv`.
-   ‚úÖ Install the latest patch version of Python 3.12 (or as configured in the script).
-   ‚úÖ Create a virtual environment named after the project folder (e.g., `pixelpress-pdf-compressor`).
-   ‚úÖ Install all required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
-   ‚úÖ Configure the directory to automatically use this environment in the future.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You may need to restart your terminal after the setup script runs for the first time to ensure the shell configuration is fully loaded.

### Step 3: Run the Application

Once setup is complete, use the `run.sh` script to start the server.

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

This script will:
-   üöÄ Start the application using a production-ready **Gunicorn server**.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è Automatically configure the optimal number of workers based on your CPU cores.
-   üåê Launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:7001`.
-   üìù Stream logs to your terminal and save them to `gunicorn.log`.

To stop the server, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.

## Manual Setup (For Linux, Windows, or non-pyenv users)

If you are not on macOS or prefer a manual setup, follow these steps.

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application

You can run the app using the simple Flask development server (good for debugging) or Gunicorn (for performance).

**Option A: Flask Development Server**
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:7001`.

**Option B: Gunicorn (Production)**
```bash
gunicorn --workers 4 --threads 2 --bind 0.0.0.0:7001 app:app
```

## How It Works

1.  **Upload:** A user selects one or more PDF files and their desired output settings via the web UI.
2.  **Queue:** The Flask backend receives each file, creates a unique task ID, and stores the job's metadata in an SQLite database. The task is marked as `queued`.
3.  **Background Processing:** The task is submitted to a background `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
4.  **Rasterization:** A worker thread picks up the task. It uses the **PyMuPDF** library to iterate through each page of the PDF.
5.  **Tiling:** For each page, it's rasterized into an image at the specified DPI. A memory-saving tiling method is used to handle very large pages without crashing.
6.  **Assembly:**
    -   If the output is **PDF**, the generated page images are inserted into a new, clean PDF document.
    -   If the output is **Image**, the page images are stitched together vertically using the **Pillow** library.
7.  **Status Updates:** The frontend periodically polls a status API endpoint to update the UI with the task's progress (`processing`, `completed`, `failed`).
8.  **Download:** Once a task is `completed`, a download link is provided to the user. The backend serves the processed file from the `processed` directory.
